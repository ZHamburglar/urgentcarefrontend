So get this:shipit:; You are a nurse in a school :school: and you have these crazy kids :boy::girl: that keep getting sick :mask:. I know its crazy but these kids get the sniffles all the way to broken necks :hurtrealbad:. But sometimes they just need some good old fashion :pill: medical :syringe: care. Now we have this program that can help doctors and nurses get in touch :telephone_receiver: and send those germ factories :factory: away so they can stop infecting :couplekiss: the rest of the school :school: with cooties :skull:. So now we have come out with a brand new :baby: program just in time for 2017 :fireworks: so act now unless you really want to miss out :sob: on this special tv :tv: offer. So break out of the old method of calling :calling: and waiting :hourglass_flowing_sand: for help, now you can use the new hip :metal: and young way of medical care :wheelchair: of the future:octocat:. Just remember that juggalos :flashlight: have allergic reactions to magnets.
